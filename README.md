# Server Hardening Scripts 
---
### THIS IS A MAJOR WIP IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS IT IS NOT IN ANY SORT OF PRODUCTION READY STATE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Planned:
- Modularize, implenting python usage to have eventually in the future an API end point for control panels to interface with
- Maybe give up and use terraform and ansible instead.
